# BloodConnect
A Project of DBMS Course

Here in this Project we made a Desktop Application using Java and MySQL via JDBC.
The Users I mean Donors need to SignUp with their Blood Group and Address(Here PinCode). So that Hospitals and BloodBanks can request Blood
when Required. As they requests a particular Blood Group they will get the list of donors living within the Hospital Pincode region.Similarly
BloodBank can do the same.

For Login we the user need to provide whether he is a Donor or Hospital or BloodBank. A Donor can create a Account here but Hospital or BloodBank
cannot, those are done by DataBaseAdministrator(DBA).
